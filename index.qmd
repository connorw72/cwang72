Hello! My name is Connor. I am a sophomore at Pomona College pursuing a Computer Science degree with a minor in data science. Outside of school I am on the Pomona-Pitzer football, where we compete in the SCIAC. My hobbies include going to the gym, playing video games, and spending time with friends.
